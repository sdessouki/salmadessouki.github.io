      <description>This is my second post after completing almost my first week of the course. It&amp;rsquo;s been really exciting, I learnt a lot about the rules of poker which was interesting. I decided to pick the hard way of coding the game taking into consideration all the suits and hands, which meant I did not get to finish but I invested around 8 hours into it, which I think is a sufficient amount.</description>

      <description>My name is Salma Dessouki and I am enjoying Lisbon. The data science course is interesting thus far but I was familiar with most of the code so it&amp;rsquo;s been good. Lisbon weather is really nice especially coming from Toronto which is really cold. Anyways, I hope you enjoy scrolling through my blog!</description>
